# Directing Customers to Subscription Products through App Behavior Analysis

In Today's Market, many companies have a mobile presence. Often, these companies provide free products/services in their mobile apps in an attempt to transition their customers to a paid membership. Some examples of paid products which originate from free ones are 'YouTube Red', 'Pandora premium' etc. Since marketing efforts are never free, these companies need to know exactly who to target with offers and promotions.

The objective of this model is to predict which users will not subscribe to the paid membership, so that greater marketing efforts can go into trying to 'convert' them to paid users.
